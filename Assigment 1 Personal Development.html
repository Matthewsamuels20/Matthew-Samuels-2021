                  <p> I think i have many more strenghts but the three most that best describes me are People skillis, Patience and Problem Solving.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p> In the last three to five years people skills have grown in my 1:1 at work I've been told that i gell with any team well and I see that as the inspire in me try to increase my people skills. I've seen where my patience as also matured too I not quick to rush and make decisions but to look at the facts before. My leadership skills have also improved I didn't really see myslef as a leader but I've been stepping up and taking leadership rolls during certain project to help better myslef.</p>
                  <p> The Tweleve Pillars is an excellent in which can live the life as an example the 4th chapter the book speaks about setting goals and explain that goals are like a road map for your life setting goals that stretch and make you do things differently with lead to a future that you want. For me personal I've serveral goals that I've set for myself these range from school to work and this chapter of the books teaches to have mulitple option in case the first plan doesn't work out the will always be a plan B.The 5th chapter teaches us about the opporunity but ther can be only one best opporunity and that we must all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.The book states "difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons.  Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on." this means that to be patience and waiting on the prefect timing weights little but the return of missed oporunity carrys a heavy burden in this I live my life by knwoing when to picking my battle in terms of the opporunity that presents itself.The 6th chapter says about the crowd that you associates yourself with and how can they benefit and help you grow for me I have wide range of friend from school friends to work friends but they people I asscoaited my self with are some great people that motivates and help each other to acommplish the dreams. The 7th chapter talks about two type of educatin formal and self education the two are the same but they carry different meaning self education is what you teach your self and formal education is what you learn for other I try to incoporate self education in my daily life beacuse not everything will be taught in school and once your out of school would have to learn about life on your own that what I been trying to do with the little knowlegde that I have.The 8th chapter says about life as a sales pitch that you always have to sale yourself and convice other I try to do this daliy whether at work, home or on the road I think its important for people to see you as a prefect choice to fill a role or give task.</p>
